# Dashboard Automation Recommendations

## Current Status ‚úÖ
- **GitHub Actions**: Working perfectly! Daily, weekly, and monthly updates are running on schedule
- **Local Repository**: Now synchronized with GitHub
- **Live Dashboard**: Updates automatically at https://www.marquisdashboard.com

## Recommended Setup

### Option 1: Rely on GitHub Actions (Recommended) üåü
Since GitHub Actions are working perfectly, you can disable local cron jobs:

```bash
# Remove local cron jobs
crontab -e
# Delete the three dashboard-related lines
```

**Benefits:**
- No local maintenance required
- Works even when your computer is off
- Automatic conflict resolution
- Free GitHub infrastructure

**Monitor automation:**
- View runs: https://github.com/dylantneal/Encore_Dashboard/actions
- Charts update automatically at midnight UTC

### Option 2: Keep Local Sync (If Needed)
If you need local copies to stay updated:

```bash
# Run weekly to sync local with GitHub
./fix_automation_sync.sh
```

Or set up a single cron job just for syncing:
```bash
# Add to crontab
0 12 * * 0 cd "/path/to/EncoreDashboard" && ./fix_automation_sync.sh
```

## Viewing Your Automation

### Check GitHub Actions Status:
1. Go to: https://github.com/dylantneal/Encore_Dashboard/actions
2. You'll see:
   - ‚úÖ Daily updates (every midnight UTC)
   - ‚úÖ Weekly updates (every Monday)
   - ‚úÖ Monthly updates (1st of month)

### Recent Successful Runs:
- July 30: Daily dashboard updated ‚úÖ
- July 29: Daily dashboard updated ‚úÖ
- July 28: Weekly dashboard updated ‚úÖ

## Troubleshooting

### If Updates Stop Appearing:
1. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/dylantneal/Encore_Dashboard/actions
2. Look for red ‚ùå marks indicating failures
3. Click on failed runs to see error details

### Common Issues:
- **Excel file changes**: Make sure `pipeline.xlsx` is valid
- **GitHub permissions**: Ensure Actions are enabled in repository settings
- **API limits**: GitHub Actions have generous limits (unlikely issue)

## Key Takeaway
Your automation is working! The GitHub Actions are successfully updating your dashboard every day. The local sync issue was preventing you from seeing these updates locally, but the live site at https://www.marquisdashboard.com has been updating correctly all along.
