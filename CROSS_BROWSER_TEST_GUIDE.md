# Cross-Browser Announcement Sync Test Guide

## 🚀 Enhanced Sync Features Now Active!

Your dashboard now has **enhanced cross-browser announcement sync** with these improvements:

### ✅ New Features Added:
- **15-second sync intervals** (instead of 60 seconds)
- **Immediate sync on browser tab focus** (when you switch back to the tab)
- **Immediate sync on window focus** (when you click back to the window)
- **Enhanced save with retry logic** (if save fails, it retries automatically)
- **Broadcast changes** (after saving, it immediately tells other browsers)

## 🧪 How to Test Cross-Browser Sync

### Test 1: Different Browsers on Same Computer
1. **Open https://www.marquisdashboard.com in Chrome**
2. **Open https://www.marquisdashboard.com in Safari/Firefox**
3. **In Chrome**: Create a new announcement
4. **Wait 15 seconds maximum** (usually much faster)
5. **In Safari/Firefox**: Should see the new announcement appear

### Test 2: Tab Focus Trigger
1. **Open dashboard in 2 browser tabs**
2. **Tab A**: Create announcement
3. **Switch to Tab B** (this triggers immediate sync)
4. **Should see announcement appear immediately**

### Test 3: Different Devices
1. **Computer**: Create announcement on https://www.marquisdashboard.com
2. **Phone/Tablet**: Open https://www.marquisdashboard.com
3. **Should sync within 15 seconds**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Console Logs to Look For:
Open Developer Tools (F12) and watch for:
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

| Action | Previous | Enhanced |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Create announcement | Sync in 60 seconds | Sync in 15 seconds max |
| Switch browser tabs | No immediate effect | Triggers immediate sync |
| Switch back to window | No immediate effect | Triggers immediate sync |
| Save fails | Lost | Automatic retry |
| Multiple browsers | Slow propagation | Fast propagation |

## 📊 Performance Impact

The enhanced sync uses more network requests but:
- ✅ Requests are small (just announcement data)
- ✅ Only when cloud sync is enabled
- ✅ Much better user experience
- ✅ Automatic retry prevents data loss

Your dashboard will now feel much more responsive across different browsers and devices!
